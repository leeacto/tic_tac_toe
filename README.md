tic_tac_toe
===========
This is a Tic Tac Toe game written all in Ruby.
You play against the AI, so it is not two player.

##Installation
Clone repo to local directory
In command line, type ruby play_ttt.rb
That's it. Pretty easy

###Additional Note
Writing the AI logic to be unbeatable was both fun and challenging. I included a .txt of the pseudocode that got me there. I now have even more respect for the Deep Blue engineers
